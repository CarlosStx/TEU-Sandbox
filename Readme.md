# TEU Sandbox – Structural Vacuum Rigidity Model  
Interactive exploration tool for the **Theory of the Empty Universe (TEU)**


## 🔭 Overview

**TEU Sandbox** is an interactive research environment to explore the  
**Theory of the Empty Universe (TEU)** through its central dynamical element:  
the *two–scale structural vacuum rigidity function*,

\[
\lambda(r) = \frac{\lambda_0}{1 + r/L_1 + (r/L_2)^2}.
\]

This repository provides:

- A fully interactive **Streamlit** interface  
- Numerical evaluation of TEU accelerations  
- Vacuum rigidity profiles  
- Comparison vs Newtonian gravity  
- Rotation curves (Newton vs TEU)  
- Stability and asymptotic regime diagnostics  
- Approximate observational data overlays (Milky Way, M31, SPARC-like)

The goal is to offer physicists and astronomers a **sandbox** to test,
probe, and extend the TEU framework across galactic and cosmological scales.
